### 🎯 Ready for Next Phase

The MVP foundation is **complete and solid**. We can now focus on:

1. **Feature Implementation**: Implementing the stub methods and expanding functionality
2. **UI Development**: Building rich user interfaces for both components
3. **AI Integration**: Connecting to actual AI services for workflow orchestration
4. **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive integration testing and user acceptance testing
5. **Documentation**: User guides, API documentation, and deployment guides

### 🛠️ What Developers Can Do Right Now

#### **Start the Integration**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start MCP Server
cd warp-extension
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Open IDE with Plugin
cd jetbrains-plugin
./gradlew runIde
```

#### **Begin Feature Development**
- Expand MCP message handlers in `McpBridgeService.kt`
- Implement AI workflows in `ai-coordinator.ts`
- Add context capture logic in `ContextSyncService.kt`
- Build UI components in both plugins

#### **Test the Foundation**
```bash
# Run the complete demo
./demo-mvp.sh

# Test server functionality
./test-mvp-startup.sh
```
