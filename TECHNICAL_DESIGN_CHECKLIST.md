# üîß Technical Design Checklist & Methodology

## üìñ Overview

This comprehensive checklist ensures systematic and thorough technical design for all components of the Warp-WebStorm Integration project. It covers architecture decisions, implementation planning, quality assurance, and documentation requirements.

## üéØ Design Principles

### Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Scalability**: Design for future growth and feature expansion
- **Reliability**: System should be fault-tolerant and recoverable
- **Performance**: Target <200ms response times for all operations
- **Security**: Security-by-design approach throughout
- **Maintainability**: Code should be readable, testable, and modifiable

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: >80% for critical components
- **Performance**: All operations within defined SLAs
- **Security**: Pass OWASP security scanning
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage
